        <h3>Legally Blonde</h3>
            <p>You can be feminine and still kick ass.</p>
        <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
            <p>Don't eat food from the spirit realm. Seriously, folklore warns about this all the time.</p>
        <h3>Kill Bill</h3>
            <p>Packets of blood. Need I say more?</p>

        <p>Wow all these movies are old. Hollywood needs to do better.</p>
        I guess <b>Oppenheimer</b> was good. Go watch that if you don't mind biopics.
